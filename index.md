My projects include work around math art, experimental video games and boring tooling.

This is a list of some of them.

## dfhack-remote

```rust
let mut client = dfhack_remote::connect().unwrap();
let world_map = client.remote_fortress_reader.get_world_map().unwrap();
println!(
    "Welcome to {} ({}). It is the year {}.",
    world_map.get_name(),
    world_map.get_name_english(),
    world_map.get_cur_year(),
);
```
